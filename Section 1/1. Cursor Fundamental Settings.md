Here we have two CSV files downloaded from the Udemy dashboard.

Here it shows you the course name, student name, timestamp, rating and comment. We manually copied the first five reviews and censored it. We just put person 1, 2, 3, 4. Let's focus on just censoring all the student names. As you can see, I have reviews uncensored.

We want to censore the entire thing. We don't want to it manually. We are going to choose Typescript. Just because, it has type definitions, which is much easier to work with large language models for coding. Just because, sometimes they make a mistake, you can immediately spot it based on the types, as opposed to dynamically typed languages like Python or R.
Let's go ahead.

We are going to use a Javascript runtime called bun. Once again, you can really use anything. If you have any questions, you can just ask Cursor in the chat. We are going to go ahead and start the project. 

First, We are going to create a Git repo just so we can save my progress. And now we are going to go ahead and create a project with bun. This will allow us to run typescript directly.

Before we do that, we want to choose out model. If you go over to Cursor -> Settings -> Cursor Settings, you will open a new tab.

Have your general, your model, settings and features in beta. If you go over to models, these are the models that we like to use;
1. Claude 3.5 Sonnet -> That's basically the best Claude model that there is at the moment that's released. In the future, you may see Claude 3.5 Opus. Definitely go for it if it's available.
   [We leave Cursor small available as well. We think, they use it for some of the small features.]

2. I turned of
