We are going to go ahead and open up our index.ts. This is basically the main file. We're going to go ahead and run it. How we run it here is we just follow this instruction. To get started, run bunrun index.ts.

This will depend on the programming language that you're choosing to use. We can see here that we are running this file. Over here, you can see the chat feature. If you don't have it open, you might have to toggle the AI pane. Here's chat.

Here we can choose the model that we are going to be using. We are going to go ahead and ask it to write code to read the reviews first five sensor.csv, press Enter. The chat pane is something very similar where you have different steps in a conversation. And show you the most advanced usage in a minute, but let's first see what this says.

Due to this saying hello via bun, this inferred that we were using bun.

If you look over here at index.ts, with that chat feature and cursor, you can attach different files. By default, it attaches the files that we have open, which was index.ts.

Here it added some code. It looks like we are going to be importing something to read files. It's saying read the CSV file and file content. It logs it and it does some error handling. That looks fine. We are going to go ahead and copy it. We can either select normal or can click copy. Cursor also does have an apply feature. The apply feature with chat is not that great. It is kind of hard for AI models to insert code. When we have a simple file like this, it should't mess up. Let's give it a try. We just click accept. We have a Typescript error here. 
<img src = "https://i.ibb.co.com/gZy7VsX9/image12.jpg"/>

Error is of type unknown because it is assuming that message is there. We think, we can just add this, but then message is an existing type object. What we are going to do is just do error. It could be anything. Now we will go ahead and run our file. Look at this content.

That's exactly what we thought. This is good. If you are writing AI generated code, or if you are working with AI generated code, sometimes it will mess up the indenting. We recommend setting up some type of linting feature or something to actually make those changes. It's not very legible. It really is a pain to try to manually indent things. So, we can do is we can go ahead and use a plugin called prettier. We are just going to ask the chat, "How can I setup prettier in my package or in my code base?" It's going to generate some instructions that are fairly good. 
Again, we wouldn't just click 'Apply'. You never really know where it's going to go because it's going to try to apply this to the Typescript file. By the way, Typescript is kind of like Javascript, but with types. There is a lot of stuff here.

For the first step, we will just copy this. Go ahead and add Prettier. That seem's reasonable. We will run it. It got installed.
