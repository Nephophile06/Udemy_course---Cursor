Here we have two CSV files downloaded from the Udemy dashboard.

Here it shows you the course name, student name, timestamp, rating and comment. We manually copied the first five reviews and censored it. We just put person 1, 2, 3, 4. Let's focus on just censoring all the student names. As you can see, I have reviews uncensored.

We want to censore the entire thing. We don't want to it manually. We are going to choose Typescript. Just because, it has type definitions, which is much easier to work with large language models for coding. Just because, sometimes they make a mistake, you can immediately spot it based on the types, as opposed to dynamically typed languages like Python or R.
Let's go ahead.
